# FEID (Free Edición Impresa Digital).

FEID is a POC (Proof of Concept) that enables the viewing of (some) publications from the Canton Group. The main publication is the newspaper called Tabasco Hoy. 

Tabasco Hoy is the major circulation newspaper in the state of Tabasco, Mexico. Since Oct 2010 they offer the possibility to read their publications online (JPG images). Although that in order to use their tool to navigate through pages you have to enroll to a paid subscription, the images of the pages are freely available on the internet without any restriction whatsoever (they place several pages in the flow of their main webpage). Their paid subscription tool is called EID Edición Impresa Digital alas the FEID name of this POC.

I the developer (scodx) do not own any copyright rights to the publications and since the images are being pulled from their servers, FEID does not store any images or content from Canton's Group (the holder company of the newspaper), the only thing that this proof of concept does is displaying them.

Being said that, this is not a tool to use to read the newspaper, if you like the publications from Canton Group go to http://eid.com.mx/ and pay for a subscription, their tool (built in Flash :s) is very useful and has advanced features that this POC doesn't. 

There is no warranty that all dates and publications searched will load, this is because this POC follows a pattern found in the public URL's of the images ( /year/month/day/publication]/ ).
