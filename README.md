# FEID (Free Edición Impresa Digital).

Tabasco Hoy is the major circulation newspaper in the state of Tabasco, Mexico. Since Oct 2010 they offer the posibility to read their publications online (JPG's images). Altghghoug that in order to use their tool to navigate trough pages you have to enroll to a paid subscription, the images of the pages are freely avilable on the internet without any restriction whatsoever (they place several pages in the flow of ther main webpage). Their paid subscription tool is called EID Edición Impres Digital alas the FEID name of this tool.

I the developer (scodx) do not own any copyright rights to the publications, and since the images are being pulled from their servers, FEID does not store any images or content from Canton's Group (the holder company of the newspaper), the only thing that this tool does is displaying them.
